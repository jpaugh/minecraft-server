    <p>Updated: 20 September 2017 09:55</p>
        
<h1 id="minecraft-end-user-license-agreement">MINECRAFT END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</h1>
<p>In order to protect Minecraft (our "Game") and the members of our 
community, we need these end user license terms to set out some rules 
for downloading and using our Game. This license is a legal agreement 
between you and us (Mojang AB) and describes the terms and conditions 
for using the Game.  We don't like reading license documents any more 
than you do, so we have tried to keep this as short as possible. If you 
break these rules we may stop you from using our Game. If we think it is
 necessary, we might even have to ask our lawyers to help out.</p>
<p>If you buy, download, use or play our Game, you are agreeing to stick
 to the rules of these end user license agreement ("EULA") terms. If you
 don't want to or can't agree to these rules, then you must not buy, 
download, use or play our Game. This EULA incorporates <a href="https://account.mojang.com/terms#website">the terms of use for the mojang.com website ("Account Terms")</a>, our <a href="https://account.mojang.com/terms#brand">brand and asset usage guidelines</a>, <a href="https://account.mojang.com/terms#privacy">our privacy policy</a>, and, if you live in the United States, <a href="https://account.mojang.com/terms#arbitration">our Arbitration Agreement</a>. By agreeing to this EULA you also agree to all of the terms of the foregoing documents, so please read through them carefully.</p>
<h2 id="binding-arbitration-and-class-action-waiver-if-you-live-in-the-united-states">BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES</h2>
<p>For those that who live in the United States, please <a href="https://account.mojang.com/terms#arbitration">click here</a>
 to review the binding arbitration agreement and class action waiver 
that is part of this EULA.  Under the agreement, we both agree to use a 
neutral arbitrator to decide any individual claims that may arise and 
thus agree to waive our rights to bring individual claims in court for 
consideration by a judge or jury.  We also agree that class action 
lawsuits and class-wide arbitrations are not allowed under the terms of 
the agreement.</p>
<p>The complete Arbitration Agreement is on <a href="https://account.mojang.com/terms#arbitration">this page</a>. You and we agree to it; please read it.</p>
<h2 id="one-major-rule">ONE MAJOR RULE</h2>
<p>The one major rule is that you must not distribute anything we've 
made unless we specifically agree to it. By "distribute anything we've 
made" what we mean is:</p>
<ul>
<li>give copies of our Game to anyone else;</li>
<li>make commercial use of anything we've made;</li>
<li>try to make money from anything we've made; or</li>
<li>let other people get access to anything we've made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable;</li>
</ul>
<p>unless we specifically agree to it. And so that we are crystal clear,
 "the Game" or "what we have made" includes, but is not limited to, the 
client or the server software for our Game and includes Minecraft and 
Minecraft: Java Edition on all platforms. It also includes updates, 
patches, downloadable content, add-ons, or modified versions of a Game, 
part of those things, or anything else we've made.</p>
<p>Otherwise we are quite relaxed about what you do - in fact we really 
encourage you to do cool stuff - but just don't do those things that we 
say you can't.</p>
<h2 id="using-our-game">USING OUR GAME</h2>
<p>You have been granted a license to the Game so you can play and use it, yourself, on your devices.</p>
<p>Below we also give you limited rights to do other things but we have 
to draw a line somewhere or else people will go too far. If you wish to 
make something pertaining to anything we've made we're humbled, but 
please make sure that it can't be interpreted as being official and that
 it complies with this EULA and the brand and asset usage guidelines and
 above all do not make commercial use of anything we've made.</p>
<p>The license and permission we give you to use and play our Game can be revoked if you break any of the terms of this EULA.</p>
<p>When you buy our Game, you receive a license that gives you 
permission to install the Game on your own personal device and use and 
play it on that device as set out in this EULA. This permission is 
personal to you, so you are not allowed to distribute the Game (or any 
part of it) to anyone else. This also means you cannot sell or rent the 
Game, or make it available for access to other people and you cannot 
pass on or resell any license keys. You may however give gift codes that
 have been bought through our official gift code system. This is 
important to help us stop piracy and fraud and to protect our Game. It 
is also important to prevent members of our community from buying 
pirated versions of our Game or fraudulent license keys - which we may 
cancel, such as in the case of fraud.</p>
<p>If you've bought the Game, you may play around with it and modify it 
by adding modifications, tools, or plugins, which we will refer to 
collectively as "Mods." By "Mods," we mean something original that you 
or someone else created that doesn't contain a substantial part of our 
copyrightable code or content. When you combine your Mod with the 
Minecraft software, we will call that combination a "Modded Version" of 
the Game. We have the final say on what constitutes a Mod and what 
doesn't. You may not distribute any Modded Versions of our Game or 
software, and we’d appreciate it if you didn’t use Mods for griefing. 
Basically, Mods are okay to distribute; hacked versions or Modded 
Versions of the Game client or server software are not okay to 
distribute.</p>
<p>Within reason you're free to do whatever you want with screenshots 
and videos of the Game. By "within reason" we mean that you can't make 
any commercial use of them or do things that are unfair or adversely 
affect our rights unless we've specifically said it's okay in this EULA,
 allowed it through the Brand and Asset Usage Guidelines, or provided 
for it in a specific agreement with you. If you upload videos of the 
game to video sharing and streaming sites you are however allowed to put
 ads on them. Also, don't just rip art resources and pass them around, 
that's no fun.</p>
<p>Essentially the simple rule is do not make commercial use of anything
 we've made unless we've specifically said it's okay. Oh and if the law 
expressly allows it, such as under a "fair use" or fair dealing" 
doctrine then that's ok too - but only to the extent that the law 
applicable to you says so.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the integrity of the Game, we need all Game 
downloads and updates to come from an authorized source. It's also 
important for us that 3rd party tools/services don't seem "official" as 
we can't guarantee their quality.  It's part of the responsibility we 
have to the customers of Minecraft.  Make sure that you read through our
 brand and asset usage guidelines too.</p>
<h2 id="ownership-of-our-game-and-other-things">OWNERSHIP OF OUR GAME AND OTHER THINGS</h2>
<p>Although we license you permission to install on your device and play
 our Game, we are still the owners of it. We are also the owners of our 
brands and any content contained in the Game. Therefore, when you pay 
for our Game, you are buying a license to play / use our Game in 
accordance with this EULA - you are not buying the Game itself. The only
 permissions you have in connection with the Game and your installation 
of it are the permissions set out in this EULA.</p>
<p>Any Mods you create for the Game from scratch belong to you 
(including pre-run Mods and in-memory Mods) and you can do whatever you 
want with them, as long as you don't sell them for money / try to make 
money from them and so long as you don’t distribute Modded Versions of 
the Game. Remember that a Mod means something that is your original work
 and that does not contain a substantial part of our code or content.  
You only own what you created; you do not own our code or content.</p>
<h2 id="content">CONTENT</h2>
<p>If you make any content available on or through our Game, you agree 
to give us permission to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, and 
publicly display that content. This permission is irrevocable, and you 
also agree to let us permit other people to use, copy, modify, adapt, 
distribute, and publicly display your content. You are not giving up 
your ownership rights in your content, you are just giving us and other 
users permission to use it.  For example, we may need to copy, reformat,
 and distribute content that you post on our website so others can read 
it.  If you don't want to give us these permissions, do not make content
 available on or through our Game. Please think carefully before you 
make any content available, because it may be made public and might even
 be used by other people in a way you don't like.</p>
<p>If you are going to make something available on or through our Game, 
it must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and it
 must be your own creation. Some examples of the types of things you 
must not make available using our Game include: posts that include 
racist or homophobic language; posts that are bullying or trolling; 
posts that are offensive or that damage our or another person's 
reputation; posts that include porn or someone else's creation or image;
 or posts that impersonate a moderator or try to trick or exploit 
people.</p>
<p>Any content you make available on our Game must also be your creation
 or you must have permission or the legal right to do it. You must not 
and you agree that you will not make any content available, using the 
Game that infringes the rights of others. '</p>
<p>We reserve the right to take down any content in our discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Please watch out if you are talking to people in our Game. It
 is hard for either you or us to know for sure that what people say is 
true, or even if people are really who they say they are. You should 
think twice about giving out information about yourself.</strong></p>
<h2 id="updates">UPDATES</h2>
<p>We might make upgrades, updates or patches (we call them all 
"updates") available from time to time, but we don't have to. We are 
also not obliged to provide ongoing support or maintenance of any Game. 
Of course, we hope to continue to release new updates for our Game, we 
just can't guarantee that we will do so.  With updates come changes that
 might not work well with other software, such as Mods. This is 
unfortunate, but it is something we don’t take responsibility for. If 
that is the case, try running an older version.</p>
<p>OUR LIABILITY, GOVERNING LAW, AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES</p>
<p>The terms of this EULA do not affect any legal (statutory) rights 
that you may have under the law that applies to you for the Game. You 
might have certain rights which the law that applies to you says cannot 
be excluded.  Nothing we say in these terms will affect those legal 
rights, even if we say something which sounds like it contradicts your 
legal rights.  That’s what we mean when we say “subject to applicable 
law”.</p>
<p>SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, When you get a copy of our Game, we 
provide it "'as is"'. Updates are also provided "'as is"'. This means 
that we are not making any promises to you about the standard or quality
 of our Game, or that our Game will be uninterrupted or error free. We 
are not responsible for any loss or damage that it may cause. You bear 
the entire risk as to its quality and performance.  You have to accept 
that we may release games well before they are complete and so they may 
(and often will) have bugs -but we prefer to release these features 
early than make you wait for perfection.  If you would like to notify us
 about a potential bug, we have a site for that here.</p>
<p><strong>If you and we ever have a dispute in court (and we hope that 
won't happen just as much as you do), the exclusive forum (that is, the 
place it will be handled) will be a state or federal court in King 
County, WA (if you live in the United States) or a court in Ontario (if 
you live in Canada). (If you live in the United States, most disputes go
 to arbitration, not court.) The laws of your state or province govern 
this EULA and all disputes, including disputes relating to it, our Game,
 or our Website, regardless of conflict of laws principles, except that 
the Federal Arbitration Act governs everything related to arbitration.</strong></p>
<h2 id="termination">TERMINATION</h2>
<p>If we want we can terminate this EULA if you breach any of the terms.
 You can terminate it too, at any time; all you have to do is uninstall 
the Game from your device and the EULA will be terminated. If the EULA 
is terminated, you will no longer have any of the rights to the Game 
given in this license.  You do still have the right to things you have 
created yourself with the game of course. The Arbitration Agreement (if 
you live in the United States) and the paragraphs about "Ownership of 
Our Game", "Our Liability" and "General Stuff" will continue to apply 
even after the EULA is terminated.</p>
<h2 id="general-stuff">GENERAL STUFF</h2>
<p>Your local law may give you rights that this EULA cannot change; if 
so, this EULA applies as far as the law allows.  Nothing in this license
 limits our liability for death or bodily injury resulting from our 
negligence or fraudulent misrepresentations.</p>
<p>We may change this EULA from time to time, if we have reason to, such
 as changes to our games, our practices, or our legal obligation.  But 
those changes will be effective only to the extent that they can legally
 apply. For example if you use the Game only in single-player mode and 
don't use the updates we make available then the old EULA applies but if
 you do use the updates or use parts of the game that rely on our 
providing ongoing online services then the new EULA will apply. In that 
case we'll inform you of the change before it takes effect, either by 
posting a notice on our Website or by other reasonable means. We're not 
going to be unfair about this though - but sometimes the law changes or 
someone does something that affects other users of the Game and we 
therefore need to put a lid on it.</p>
<p>If you come to us with a suggestion for any one of our Websites or 
Games, that suggestion is made for free and we have no obligation to 
accept or consider it. This means we can use or not use your suggestion 
in any way we want and we don't have to pay you for it. If you think you
 have a suggestion that we would be willing to pay you for, please do 
not submit your suggestion unless you have first told us you expect to 
be paid <strong>and</strong> we have responded in writing by asking you to submit the suggestion.</p>
